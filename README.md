Sip & Play

We created a super cool website just for our client! We used three.js to make a truly awesome 3D menu that looks super neat. The whole website got a makeover with a fresh, eye-catching design. It has four main parts: a calendar to show all the fun events, the cool 3D menu we made, a super stylish homepage, and a page with all the latest news about the business to help people learn more about them, as well as a page to inform the customers of the beginning and the whereabouts of the cafe.

This was an incredible learning experience for us and sharpened our collaborating skills. It was also a fun project to work on with all the 3d models.

For our tech stack, we chose Next.js for its ability to do server-side rendering out of the box with the use of a well-known framework such as React. This was important for the search engine optimization which also was another thing that was expected from the client as part of the brief. Last but not least, we have achieved beyond what was asked as a team and have succeeded at our mission to create the most functional, aesthetically pleasing, easy-to-use website capable of bringing many more customers to our client.
